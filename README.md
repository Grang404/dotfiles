This is a collection of my personal dotfiles, configured for my own setup.

⚠️ WARNING:

`install.sh` modifies system settings, including Firefox, DNS, and GRUB.
It is **not recommended** for use on other systems.

Feel free to use these dotfiles for inspiration, reference, or adapting parts to your own setup.
